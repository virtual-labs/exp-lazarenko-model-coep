### To quantify the stock removal rate from basic concept of bulk boiling for metals using Lazeranko's model

### Objective
1. To estimate the effect of pulse energy and pulse width on crater depth, crater volume assuming bulk boiling using Lazeranko's model
2. To understand the phenomenon of over cut, taper and surface finish as a result of variation in pulse energy
