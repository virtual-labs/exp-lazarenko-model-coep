After adding this extensions you can play animation and perform the experiment.

### Steps :

1. To gather basic knowledge of Wire cut Electrical Discharge Machining.
2. To determine heated volume in solid state, melt state and evaporation state (crater volume) using MATLAB.
3. In second stage of experiments to correlate/ compare results obtained experimentally with the theoretical ones.
